# SLDS Linter

## Overview

SLDS Linter provides custom linting rules specifically built for Salesforce Lightning Design System 2 (SLDS 2 beta). SLDS Linter is designed to uplift your Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), Lightning Web Component (LWC), and Aura component files to SLDS 2 and to conform to SLDS best practices. SLDS Linter rules allow you to maintain consistent styling and identify common issues when working with Lightning components.

## Features

- Component Linting:
  The utility supports linting for two types of Salesforce Lightning components:

  LWC and Aura components.
  - LWC Components (.html): Linting is applied to Lightning Web Components.
  - Aura Components (.cmp): Linting is applied to Aura Components.

* Stylelint for CSS Files:
  Stylelint rules are applied to .css files associated with the components. This ensures consistent styling practices are followed throughout the project.

Follow the below instructions to integrate SLDS Linter into your project.

## Set Up SLDS Linter in Your Component Repository

### Pre-requisites

SLDS Linter CLI tool works best with the [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) version of Node.js.  

#### **Minimum Required Node.js Version**  
- The minimum supported Node.js version is **v20.18.3**.  
- We recommend using the latest **Active LTS** release for the best performance and compatibility.  
- The tool verifies the Node.js version at the beginning of the process. If the Node.js requirements are met, the subsequent steps will proceed smoothly.

#### Extensions
To enhance your linting and error analysis experience, consider installing the following VSCode extensions:

- *[ESLint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)*: This extension is essential for JavaScript/TypeScript linting and will show squiggly lines over code that violates the ESLint rules.
- *[Stylelint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)*: For linting CSS, SCSS, and other stylesheets, this extension will highlight errors with squiggly lines.
- *[SARIF Viewer Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-SarifVSCode.sarif-viewer)*: For better viewing and navigating through SARIF files.
These extensions will significantly improve your development workflow and make it easier to navigate and address linting issues.

These options can also be visualised by using `--help` with each command. For example: Running `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter lint --help` will give the options which can be used along with `lint`.

#### Detailed Steps

1. Run `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter lint` to see the lint output on terminal. For specific files, you can go ahead with either `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter lint:styles` for lint errors within css files or `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter lint:components` for lint errors within html/cmp files. To run the linting only on a specific folder, use the option `-d` to specify the directory to be linted. 
2. The linting output displayed in the console includes the row and column numbers on the left. Navigate to the specific line of concern in the source code by clicking on these numbers (Command + Click on Mac).
3. To run SLDS Linter, in Terminal, run `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter report` to generate a Sarif report in the project root directory. To run it on a different directory, use `-d` to run the report on that directory. For output, `-o` can be used to specify a different output folder for the genreated sarif. It will be named as `slds-linter-report.sarif`.
4. Open the generated Sarif file.
5. Make a note of how many components SLDS Linter has identified that you must update.
6. Run `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter lint --fix` to automatically fix validation errors in bulk.
7. Run `npx @salesforce-ux/slds-linter emit` to emit the configuration files used by slds-linter cli, defaults to current working directory. These configuration files will be discovered by VSCode ESLint/Stylelint extensions to display squiggly lines in css/html files when opened in editor. Please ensure ESLint and Stylelint extensions are enabled.

#### Troubleshooting SARIF Viewer Navigation
If the SARIF viewer is not automatically navigating you to the line of code when you click on an error/warning, follow these steps:

- Click on "Locate" in the popup that appears from the extension.
- Locate the file in the file explorer or editor.
- Once the file is located, you should be able to click on the errors in the SARIF viewer, and it will navigate you directly to the specific line of code.

For any questions or issues, feel free to reach out to the maintainers or open an issue in the repository.
